# UI Improvements and Animations Guide

## Overview
I've enhanced the SubTrack app with professional animations and improved functionality for handling variable costs like electricity bills. The app now has smooth transitions, engaging micro-interactions, and better data visualization while maintaining the original color theme.

## 🎨 Color Theme Maintained

### 1. **Variable Cost Support**
- Added `cost_type` field (fixed/variable)
- Support for bills like electricity, water, gas
- Average cost tracking for variable subscriptions
- Cost history tracking capability
- Visual indicator for variable costs (~₱ prefix)

### 2. **Yearly Statistics**
- Total yearly cost calculation
- Monthly average display
- Accounts for different billing cycles (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- Smart calculation for variable costs using averages

### 3. **Enhanced Categories**

- 💡 Utilities
- 💼 Productivity
- 🏃 Health & Fitness
- 📚 Education
- 📦 Other

- Optimized re-renders with proper dependencies

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript support for new fields
- Proper interfaces for variable costs
- Type-safe animation props

### User Experience

### Cost Display Logic
```typescript
// Fixed costs: ₱500
// Variable costs: ~₱500 (shows average)
// Handles all billing cycles correctly
```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Adding a Fixed Subscription
